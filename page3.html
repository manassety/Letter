        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I just want to take a moment to say <strong>I'm really sorry</strong> for what happened yesterday during the YouTube stream. 
            It was never my intention to upset you, and knowing that you felt that way truly hurts me.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            You are an amazing person, Ayeshu, and your presence means a lot to me. I really value our friendship, and 
            I’d never want to do anything to make you feel bad. If I said or did anything that hurt you, please know 
            that it was unintentional, and I deeply regret it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I hope you can forgive me and we can continue to share all the good moments together. You are important 
            to me, and I will always respect and appreciate you.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 font-bold mt-6">Your Friend Always,</p>
